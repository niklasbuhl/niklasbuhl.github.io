In order to make people have attention to their usage.\nThe upgrade to Aqubiqs sensor system were a module to save important data on a flashdrive instead of relying on internet connection. As it is my experience from previous projects and personal experience at Roskilde Festival - There is no certainty of internet, power, no-being peed on or stolen.\nImplementing IoT system to measure water consumption at Roskilde Festival to analyse for reduction.
