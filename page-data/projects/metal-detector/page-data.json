Un- fortunately this method is not always the best because inside this wood, there's often metal from previous usage, like nails and screws. These pieces of metal damages the tools that is used to prepare the wood for new usage, some time even de- stroys it.\\nTherefore we've come up with a solution that will locate the metal and mark it, so it can either be discarded, removed or an area or piece of wood can be cut away. So the wood can processed and manufactured easilier.\\nIn this project a Xlinix Zybo is used as main controlling unit while a lot of periphials like sensors and actuators are used to handle the pieces of wood.
