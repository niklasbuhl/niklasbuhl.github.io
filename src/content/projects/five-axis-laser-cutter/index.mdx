## Description

A DIY open source five axis laser cutter project.
Design of system architecture and developed a SketchUp extension to generate GCode from 3D model to laser cutter.
Adding 2-3 degrees of freedom to the machine.
Please let me know if you are interested in this project, then I will publish it as soon as possible.
Initially started as a project at DTU Diplom by Jacob Lawaetz, having several student do special semester projects on component or element of the complete project. Recently Jacob left DTU and we decided to continue working on the project in our free time.
The purpose of this project is to create a laser cutter that can make geometries that one can only dream of today.
The laser cutter will be a new tool for the toolbox with digital manufacturing technologies.
During my work at DTU Innovation Support I worked on the system architecture with Jacob.
Additionally as a part of my education at DTU I did a special course with Jacob and Jesper to develop an extension to the 3D modelling program SketchUp to generate GCode from models, the laser cutter would then be able to follow and cut the models.
Assisting a project lead by Jacob Lawaetz to create an open source 5 axis lasercutter system.
The purpose of this project is to create a laser cutter that can make geometries that one can only dream of today. The laser cutter will be a new tool for the toolbox with digital manufacturing technologies.
Design of system architecture and developed a SketchUp extension to generate GCode from 3D model to laser cutter. Might continue late 2020.
The purpose of this project is to create a laser cutter that can make geometries that one can only dream of today. The laser cutter will be a new tool for the toolbox with digital manufacturing technologies.

Technical University of Denmark in Ballerup.
In a basement he is working on an open source 5-axis laser cutter which is supposed to be used at the Copenhagen FabLab in the future.

### Complete System

Adding two degrees of freedom to the machine.
Upgrading the ordinary 2-axis laser cutter to 5-axis in order to expand cutting opportunities into the realm of 3D.

### SketchUp Extension

5-Axis Gcode Computing from 3D Model with a SketchUp Extension
SketchUp Extension in Ruby
