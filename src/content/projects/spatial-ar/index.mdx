<!-- # Spatial Augmented Reality -->

## Description

Projector system.
Projection of an interface onto physical moving objects for various future applications.
Codename: Neon
IR Camera array for motion tracking
Projector robot Tipron
Using a projector-robot, CV and Unity I built a system to create an AR experience, intended for interactive interaction with physical objects without display or glasses.
