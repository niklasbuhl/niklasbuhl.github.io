<!-- # IBIZ -->

## Description

During my internship at IdemoLab I worked on various projects, this is particularly mentionable.
A concept to help customers in a MENY supermarket finding product categories amongst on the isles.
Light bulbs in the ceiling animated the route they should follow.
An tablet with a web-application worked as the interface between the user and the system.
Researching how smart technology can benefit people in retail stores
Various prototyping projects, and a system for customers in supermarkets to easier find products with light guidance.
As a part of large project collaboration between FORCE Technology, Alexandra Institutet and Meny in order to research in how new technology might improve user experience while grocery shopping.
I did a project to make finding the location of products easier.
Through an interface you could find a product in a database, and then get directed by interactive lights in the roof who would lead you to the aisle.
