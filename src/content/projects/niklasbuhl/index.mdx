## This Website

Coded all components from scratch. Only using the Gatsby enviroment because it were able to use MDX with frontmatter at the same time.

My personal startup, portfolio and sharing space in the cyberverse.
This website is my online playground and personal space on the internet. I want to share my thoughts, writings, showcase my projects - And if I end up putting a dent in the world, or maybe just a smile on someones face - I am happy.
