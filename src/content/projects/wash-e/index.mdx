<!-- # WASH-E -->

## Description

We tore down a conventional washing machine and did a re-design proces in order to improve climate impact or user experience.
In our problem finding phase design analysis, research and interviews we found that changing the ball bearings would mean a total replacement of the washing machine.
We came up with a concept to make replace or repair the ball bearings easier.
Upgrading the washing machine.
