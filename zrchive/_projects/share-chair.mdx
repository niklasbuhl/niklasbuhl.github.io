<!-- # Share Chair -->

## Description

At Roskilde Festival, almost everyone brings an exemplar of the popular camping chair. They almost all break, within a few days if not taken care of properly. And most of them are left behind for the volunteers to clean them up as trash.

A product service concept called Share Chair.
