          IdemoLab bridges the gap between technology and design. We focus on
          the important early stages of the design process and strive to create
          meaningful experiences for users and customers. IdemoLab specialises
          in validating the ideas of customers, through holistic user oriented
          product development, prototyping and testing in real-life situations,
          to close the gap between people and technology, and have a viable
          business plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          At IdemoLab I designed and developed of various prototypes within the
          field of digitalisation, internet of intelligent things and software
          applications. Some of the POCs I worked on include: A system in a
          supermarket manipulating lights in the ceiling to direct users to
          unknown positions of a product (LINK). A interfaces to collect and
          show the bus times at the nearby bus-stop (LINK) or weather
          information through a light installation (LINK). A tracking device to
          put inside the box of delicate wares before shipping, in order to

        <h3>B.Eng IT-Electronics from Technical University of Denmark</h3>
        <p>2015 - 2019</p>
        <p>
          A broad study in the cross-field between IT and electronics, to
          develop intelligent functions in a variety of applications and
          hardware/software embedded-systems. I studied hardware-near
          programming, microprocessors and electronics, general computer
          science, the mathematics behind and embedded systems engineering to
          develop new intelligent functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In projects have done extensive C/C++ programming for example in
          OpenFrameworks, where I made a visualisation and control application
          of an intelligent drone, with onboard camera for computer vision. We
          have also been introduced to Assembly code and FPGA programming.

        <h3>⅔ B.Sc Sustainable Design from </h3>
        <p>2013 - 2015</p>
        <p>
          Before studying at DTU I studied B.Sc. Sustainable Design for two
          years, because I think it is extremely important the designers of
          tomorrow will make up for what the previous generation, of course
          unknowingly, messed up and push the tech industry into more
          sustainable and ethical solutions. Not just technology, but also the
          approach to technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this study I learned a lot about project management, industrial
          design, holistic design thinking, co-creation, user involvement, the
          soft aspects of prototyping, classic engineering disciplines and how
          to create value in a fusion of trifold sustainability. I worked on
          various projects to ease climate impact and improve social welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed four out of six semesters before finally decided to pursue
          my passion for tech, I wanted the hard competencies build the
          concepts.
